# Using Kendo UI with Vapor.js

Kendo UI is awesome, but you knew that. Vapor.js is also awesome, but you knew that too. What you didn't know is that Kendo UI + Vapor.js is awesomerer than anything. 

## Getting started with Vapor.js

[Vapor.js](http://vaporjs.com) is our favorite library, second to Kendo UI, of course. It's so easy to use. Just add a reference to your page:

    <script src="https://raw.github.com/madrobby/vapor.js/master/vapor.js"></script>

Vapor is fast. Lightning fast. You can EVEN put it in your `<head>`, it's so fast:

    (function() {
        console.log("Fastest. Library. Ever.") 
    })();

Every time we use Vapor.js, a party breaks out around the office. Here's a clip:
