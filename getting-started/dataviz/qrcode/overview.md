# QRCode Overview
QRCode widget helps you easily generate canvas/svg image representing a QRCode. QR is short for Quick Response (they can be read quickly by a cell phone). 
They are used to take a piece of information from a transitory media and put it in to your cell phone.
All graphics are rendered on the client using Canvas/SVG with a fallback to VML for legacy browsers.
