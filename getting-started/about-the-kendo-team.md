# About the Kendo UI Team

Kendo UI is made by Telerik. Our engineering team is based in Sofia, Bulgaria, with additional team members in Australia, Boston, Houston, Austin and some podunk city in Tennessee. 

## What we do in our spare time

More HTML, CSS and JavaScript development, of course! 

Our favorite library is [Vapor.js](http://vaporjs.com/). It's so easy to use. Just add a reference to your page:

    <script src="https://raw.github.com/madrobby/vapor.js/master/vapor.js"></script>

You can EVEN put it in the `<head>`. Vapor is *THAT* fast:

    (function() {
        console.log("Fastest. Library. Ever.") 
    })();


Even with all this coding, on occasion, we do like to cut loose. Here's a sample:
