# How-To: Use the DataSource Component

In this how-to, we'll examine how to use the DataSource component of Kendo UI.

The DataSource component plays a central role in the applications and sites built with Kendo UI. Fundamentally, it is an abstraction over local or remote data. However, it has many other responsibilities as well, including:

* retrieving data from a remote endpoint;
* maintaining the structure and type of the data it represents (schema);
* processing serialization formats to/from a remote endpoint;
* synchronizing updates (i.e. create, update, delete) to/from a remote endpoint;
* maintaining an in-memory cache of data (including changes) for a batch update to a remote endpoint;
* calculating and maintaining aggregates, sorting order, and page sizes;
* and, providing a query mechanism via filter expressions.
