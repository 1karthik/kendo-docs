# Welcome to Kendo UI

Kendo UI is an HTML5, jQuery-based framework for building modern web apps. The framework features lots of UI widgets, a rich data vizualization framework,
an auto-adaptive Mobile framework, and all of the tools needed for HTML5 app development, such as Data Source, Templating, MVVM, Drag-and-Drop API, and more.

Kendo UI comes in several different bundles:

* Kendo UI Core - free open source version of Kendo UI licensed under Apache 2.0, including web and mobile widgets and framework features.
* Kendo UI Professional - includes web, dataviz and mobile widgets and framework features.
* Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC - Kendo UI Professional plus ASP.NET MVC wrappers for all available widgets.
* Telerik UI for JSP - Kendo UI Professional plus JSP wrappers for the available web and dataviz widgets.
* Telerik UI for PHP - Kendo UI Professional plus PHP wrappers for the available web and dataviz widgets.

## Server-side wrappers

Kendo UI provides server-side wrappers for ASP.NET, PHP and JSP. Those are classes (ASP.NET and PHP) or XML tags (JSP)
which allow configuring the Kendo UI widgets with server-side code.

You can find more info about the server-side wrappers here:
